I wanted a home that feels like it booted off a floppy but speaks fluent modern web. This site is that mix: a retro shell over a markdown-first system.

## What this place is

- A slow feed of notes, essays, and experiments.
- A mirror of the things I care about professionally and personally.
- A front door that stays small, legible, and easy to maintain.

## How it works

Every post is a markdown file with frontmatter. Add a new folder under `src/routes/posts/` and drop in a `+page.md`. The site picks it up, builds a route, and the archive updates.

## The identity link

I use Bluesky as the public identity anchor. This site is connected to that profile and references it as the main node for new updates.

If you are reading this, welcome. If you are here from a mention, hello again.
