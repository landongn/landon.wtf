Medium made writing feel like a ritual. That feeling is worth keeping, even if the stack is different now. I want a workflow that is calm, repeatable, and does not demand a CMS to ship a thought.

## The rule

If a post cannot be a single markdown file, it is too complicated. This keeps the writing loop short: draft, preview, publish.

## The loop

1. Create a new folder under `src/routes/posts/<slug>/`.
2. Write the markdown in `+page.md`.
3. Ship.

## The reading side

A good reading view should feel like paper on a desk. No chrome, no arguments, just the text. The progress bar and the minimal metadata are enough.

If you want a copy of the template, grab one of the posts and remix it.
